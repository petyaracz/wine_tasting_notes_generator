# Wine tasting notes generator code

A language model for... wine reviews. Pick a variety, decide whether you like it or not, and click a button to get the review.

You can try the model [here](https://petyaracz.shinyapps.io/winetaster/).

This tiny [Rshiny](https://shiny.rstudio.com/) project is built on Drew Schmidt and Christian Heckendorf's [ngram](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/ngram/README.html) library for R. The training data were collected by zackthoutt and published on [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/zynicide/wine-reviews).
